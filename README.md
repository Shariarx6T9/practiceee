🌿 GreenNest

Hey there! 👋
This is GreenNest — my project for an indoor plant nursery web app.
It’s built to be modern, clean, and fully responsive, with a calm green vibe all around.
You can explore plants, learn how to care for them, and manage your own user profile — everything in one simple and friendly place.
